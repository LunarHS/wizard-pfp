Pixel Wizard PFP Maker

A standalone, browser‑based app to create pixel‑style wizard profile pictures. No dependencies, no backend, everything runs locally.

Features

🎨 Pixel Editor — Paint directly on a square pixel grid.

🧙 Templates — Start with a default Wizard or Wizard + Headset (CS support theme).

🪄 Brush & Eyedropper — Choose colors or pick from existing pixels.

🌈 Quick Palette — One‑click access to a range of preset colors.

🧩 Group Fill — Recolor all pixels in a group (hat, robe, headset, background) at once.

🔲 Grid Toggle — Show or hide grid lines while editing.

📐 Resizable Pixels — Change pixel size in the editor.

💾 Export to JPEG — Save your design as a 1:1 square JPEG, with or without grid lines.

Usage

Open index.html in your browser (double‑click or drag into a tab).

Use the controls panel on the left to:

Select a template (Wizard / Wizard + Headset).

Paint pixels with the brush tool or recolor groups.

Adjust pixel size for easier editing.

Toggle grid lines for clarity.

When done, click Export JPEG to download your creation.

Exports as a square image suitable for profile pictures.

Toggle Include grid lines in export to overlay the grid.

Hosting

Because it’s a single HTML file, you can host it anywhere:

GitHub Pages — drop index.html into a repo and enable Pages.

Netlify/Vercel — drag‑and‑drop deploy.

Local use — no server needed.

Notes

Right‑click while painting = erase.

Eyedropper mode lets you click a pixel to set your brush color.

Export scale (default 32) determines the resolution — higher = bigger output.
